I only work on ImageNet dataset.</br>.
In github, in exps folder thereâ€™s two files:</br>
1)ease_ina.json</br>
2)ease_ina_in21k.json</br>
Where I store parameters to train Ease model and getting result.</br>
Expandable Subspace Ensemble (EASE) method to solve the problem of catastrophic forgetting in Class-Incremental Learning (CIL). In CIL, a model must learn new tasks sequentially without forgetting knowledge from previous tasks.</br>
</br>
</br>
In Basic file:</br>
Vit_ease file.py for feature embedding x</br>
in Linear.py cosine similarty into subspaces</br>
</br>
</br>
into Utlis folder for model evaluation</br>
</br>
</br>
In model folder,Ease.py for implementaion
